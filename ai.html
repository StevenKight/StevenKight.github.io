							How much can a single student accomplish in a day? <br>
							The goal of this work is to create a UWG-specific personal assistant to help students through daily tasks as well as more specific tasks that are geared to help them accomplish more. 
							Some such tasks include retrieving class date and location, identifying classes in current schedules, as well as learning about current events going on around the campus of UWG and more.
							<br><br>
							Code and more can be found on the Github:

							Linear Algebra is the basis for many of the algorithms used in Machine Learning. 
							Typically, these algorithms are used to solve problems that are too complex for humans to solve in a reasonable amount of time.<br>
							When it comes to Linear Algebra, BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are used to solve these problems.<br>
							Open source BLAS libraries are available for use, but they are not optimized for the hardware they are running on.
							Companies like Intel and AMD have created their own BLAS libraries that are optimized for their hardware, but they are not open source.<br>
							This project aims to see what kind of performance can be achieved by using the open source BLAS libraries and the proprietary BLAS libraries.
