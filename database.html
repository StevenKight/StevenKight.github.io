							A project in Information Management designed to allow myself and a partner to create a database for a fictional company.<br>
							This company (called RentMe) rented out furniture to members.

							RST LLC was using an almost all paper method of storing data about work done and passing that up the chain. 
							They found this to be good for years, but as the buisness grew, this was not enough. They asked me to help them modernize their systems.
							This database was my attempt at doing so after I had worked with them to see their needs and what they wanted in a database.
							The information within is directly from them and the stored information is what they wanted to be able to know about previous work done.
