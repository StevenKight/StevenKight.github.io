            <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Steven Kight</strong>—a software engineer with a keen interest in data science, artificial intelligence, and physics simulations. If it involves solving complex problems with code (and ideally some matrix math), I'm probably into it.</p>

            <p>I began my journey as a physics major, captivated by the elegance of physical laws and the creativity of design. My passion for graphics, computers, and exploring how things work led me to a pivotal encounter with a professor who opened the door to computer science. That moment sent me on a new trajectory to the University of West Georgia, where I dove deep into software development and research—particularly in AI and simulations.</p>

            <p>Since then, I've built experience across a wide range of technical areas: REST API development, database design, web development, automation engineering, and of course, my first love—AI. Currently, I work as an <strong>Automation Engineer</strong>, where I continue to sharpen my skills while always keeping an eye on the broader horizon of intelligent systems.</p>

            <p>My academic and professional pursuits have given me the chance to collaborate across disciplines—working with departments like English, Physics, and Chemistry on research that blends technical rigor with human context. Some highlights include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                A <strong>campus smart assistant</strong>, built around multi-modal learning using face, voice, and class schedule data. I presented this work at multiple conferences, including the Georgia Undergraduate Research Conference.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Nuclear reactor simulation research</strong>, focusing on practical reactor usage. For this project, I teamed up with physics and chemistry faculty to explore real-world applications of theoretical models.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm deeply motivated by a <strong>love of learning</strong>—it's the thread that connects all my work. Whether it's the latest in machine learning or a new trick in CAD modeling, I'm probably reading about it, building it, or breaking it to see how it ticks.</p>

            <p>If you're into AI, simulation, or just think debugging is a personality trait, we might just get along.</p>
