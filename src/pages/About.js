                Hi, I'm Steven Kight — a software engineer driven by a passion for AI, physics simulations, and solving complex problems with elegant code 
                (ideally involving a bit of matrix math).
            </p>

            <p>
                I originally set out as a physics major, drawn to the beauty of physical laws and the creativity of design. 
                A chance conversation with a professor sparked my shift to computer science, setting me on a path to the University of West Georgia, 
                where I focused on software development, intelligent systems, and research-driven projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since then, I've worked across diverse areas: REST APIs, database design, web development, automation engineering, and — always — artificial intelligence. 
                Most recently, I've held roles as an AI Engineer and Automation Engineer, building production-ready systems and deploying solutions on 
                cloud-native infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
                I thrive at the intersection of disciplines, collaborating with teams in English, Physics, and Chemistry to bridge technical rigor with real-world impact. 
                A few highlights:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Campus Smart Assistant: </strong> 
                    An AI-driven tool using facial and voice recognition to help students manage class schedules, 
                    presented at the Georgia Undergraduate Research Conference and other venues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Physics Research &amp; Application Development: </strong> 
                    Partnered with faculty to explore and apply complex physics models in software, blending theory and practical implementation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Continuous learning is my driving force — whether it's the latest in machine learning or a new trick in CAD modeling, 
                I'm probably building it, testing it, or breaking it apart to see how it works.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're passionate about AI, simulation, or think debugging is a personality trait, we'll probably get along.
            </p>
